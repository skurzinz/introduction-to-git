# introduction-to-git

Repo for a short introduction into the Git VCS with humanities scholars as a target group

Somehow obsolete as pitchme does not work any longer.

## Folders

- **chapters** contains slide sources in markdown for pitchme 
- **templates** contains styling for pitchme
- **text-files** is for uploading data as a test case
